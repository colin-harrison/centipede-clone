My take on the classic arcade game Centipede

## Rules

The player begins the game with 3 lives. Lives can be lost via collisions with any segment of the centipede or the spider. The player can move through mushrooms freely. Each segment of the centipede has 2 lives, as well as the spider.

When the player loses a life all of the damaged mushrooms on the board are restored and a new centipede will spawn in the top right. The spider will be restored to it's full health.

## Scoring

Hitting a centipede segment: 2 pts

Destroying a centipede segment: 5 pts

Hitting a mushroom: 1 pts

Destroying a mushroom: 5 pts
Each mushroom restored: 10 pts
Hitting the spider: 100 pts
Killing the spider: 600 pts
Killing the centipede: 600 pts
